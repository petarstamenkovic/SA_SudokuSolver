Solving sudoku using Simulated Annealing Heuristic 

This project features a sudoku solver using a well known algorithmic heuristic Simulated Annealing. I used the body of the developers
from the yarpiz.com site and modified it to fit my project. In this repo :
  1. Two folders that contain initial sudoku instances - L (Easy) , S (Medium) , T (Hard) where some of them have issues and the other folder(sudoku_instances_2) with hard ones.
  2. Folder that contain .m files where you should run the main.m file in order to test it
  3. Documentation of the project (on Serbian)

If you want to modify the performance i suggest you experiment with various combinations of control parameter **temperature** and **number of iterations**.
